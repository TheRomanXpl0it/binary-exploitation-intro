# brute me
## Stage 1 - 140 points
Brute force this server compiled with position independent executable. There are two ways to do this: the dumb way and the l33t hacker way.

The flag is ccit{found base address in hex} (ex: ccit{0x4007337})

## Stage 2 - 230 points
To solve this challenge you need to solve "brute_me - stage 1" before.

Write a ropchain that depends on the found base address, leak the libc and reach the flag.

Note: execve("/bin/sh") doesn't work if you don't use dup2 to redirect stdout and stdin to the socket

Patching the binary is useful during debugging to avoid fork and debug the vulnerable function
